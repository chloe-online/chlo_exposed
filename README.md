## a log of my life: told through weekly injections

Every week from June, 6th of 2023 until I die I have to take hormones that are administered as an intramuscular injection. In order to not scar myself I rotate the location in my legs where I perform the shot, left to right every week moving up my legs bottom, middle and then top.

While doing this I also like to add a comment about my life or the shot or something to give this action more meaning.
