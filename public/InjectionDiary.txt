<div>a number for feelings welled up within me last night. this feeling of being a teenager and being trapped knowing i wanted to be a woman but holding my tongue and not letting myself take the leap to being one. the freedom in my body i imagined back then, of how id feel when every knew, is a feeling i am used to now. i love how i can feel myself now. i have overcome the wall i built up in my mind. i have stopped the autonomic response of hiding the girl i always have been. maybe its cringe to say this but i wish i could touch her now and tell her it will work out in the end, that the nights of tears will become ones of joy and happiness, and that the body and mind that she pleaded to god for was already hers.</div>

<div>watching ethel cain, hayden anhedonia, talk about zelda in this moment. im in this limbo period between jobs where i am excitedly waiting for new opportunity and feeling a lack of motivation for finishing my current job. the fast approach of two years of hormonal change has me feeling contentedly introspective. in these two years i have achieved a dramatic shift in my internal calmness of body and mind. i have not been misgendered in such a long time that i cannot really pin the last time someone externalized that they see me as a man/not-a-woman. i think it was when i was at the velvet lounge on north loop in austin the day i bought that isabel marant dress as retaliation. and yet i still want to erase the last parts of me that i identify as giving away my history. unsure how to feel still at this momentâ€¦</div>

<div>very large life news, i will be starting a new job in the city. feels like a very big girl moment for me. not quite sure how to feel about leaving my old work and starting new, but that's what life is about! really hoping to learn as much as i can and make something awesome.</div>

<div>i couldn't feel the way she slid the needle into my flesh, but my body beat around where she entered. i kissed her ear but not to hard so as to break her focus.</div>

<div>forgot to write this yesterday so adding thoughts now. started a new uln project making a beautiful group messenger app to use with my friends. really excited about it and with working more on uln industries with jake. in other news my running has been going well. having constant exercise in my life has dramatically improved my mood and i have much more energy for side projects now.</div>

<div>i cannot point exactly to when it happened but my body and the way it has changed feels normal. i no longer wake up telling myself who i am, i just wake up as her. this week i made my triumphant return to brooklyn, it is starting to be home now but for how long i am unsure. the united states seems to slip further and further into something i cannot reckon with. i fear for many people who also call this city their home, who may be removed with no notice seemingly to some dangerous evil place. in lighter news, i started running this week. being active will help with my melancholy.</div>

<div>twenty six, but also my first birthday as chloe. its strange to have lived multiple lives and to have a separation of past identity. i guess this is the case for everyone, but usually one gets to live in this fantasy where the â€˜youâ€™ of ten years ago is the same as the â€˜youâ€™ now. and yet today and each new week i feel more like a woman than i ever have, so something to look forward to.</div>

<div>another week another shot. i think that doing them has finally become mundane. got date invitation rescinded because im trans for the first time, so that's exciting little milestone. to be expected but it does shatter my illusion that i can just be a 'normal' girl.</div>

<div>line of blood down my leg, tried to take a video of it and almost got blood all over my sheets. working on a new song thatâ€™s much darker than my previous but feeling really great about it. important news! i now have a date for surgery. long ways away but that ball is rolling.</div>

<div>went to a dog show and saw lots of family this past week. no revelations, just normal which has not been my standard for the past several months. settling into my new life in the city. feeling an absence of something un-namableâ€¦</div>

<div>slight burning sensation as the needle exited my muscle, no blood. i am returning to an uneasy sense of normalcy, but many wonderful developments in my personal life. meeting new friends; started learning how to perform my music live, with dreams of playing for an audience; practiced bass; made some fixes to this site including upgrading to svelte 5 (accidentally let the llm write svelte 4 lmao); and continued opening myself to new experiences. love as always.</div>

<div>what is there to say. it feels as though fascism has it's tendrils around the united states and my people are the enemy. i now cannot go into federal bathrooms without the risk of retribution, classrooms, medicine, prisons all pose an increased risk. i'm still going tho, very fortunate to have moved to new york. finding ways to be myself and live my life. trying to become a member of a synth library so i can play analogue synths &lt3</div>

<div>this is a difficult entry to write because of how the social climate has seems to invert since my last injection. it is now the united states official policy that i should not be who i am and my life is now in opposition of the country i was born into. deeply troubling is an understatement, but people like me have always found our way in spite of societal hatred of our existence. if you cannot find love and acceptance of all people on this earth, know there will never be a place for you in the world we will build.</div>

<div>very important special date! this is when I first started taking estrogen (you could even call it a birthday). logging doesnâ€™t start until august, because when i started i was prescribed estradiol in its pill form so there was no need to log weekly injection site</div>
